## Local Development

1. Install [NodeJS v16.13](https://nodejs.org/tr/blog/release/v16.13.0/) (or switch using [`asdf install`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf))

2. Install `craco` via `$ npm install @craco/craco --save --global`  
   (NB - you may need to reload terminal session to use the alias)

3. `$ git clone` repo to desired destination and `$ cd pd-live-react` into directory.

4. Install dependencies with `$ npm install` and run application locally using `$ npm start`  
   (e.g. app will be available under http://localhost:3000/ - be sure to remove pd-live-react suffix)

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

These steps assume you have forked the repo to a new GitHub repo and wish to deploy using [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages).

1. Modify `homepage` within `package.json` accordingly (e.g. https://[GIT_USERNAME].github.io/pd-live-react/)

2. PagerDuty Configuration

   - Within PagerDuty developer mode, [register a new app](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/ZG9jOjExMDI5NTY5-register-an-app)
   - [Add OAuth 2.0 workflow](<(https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/ZG9jOjExMDI5NTcz-o-auth-2-0-functionality#add-oauth-20-functionality-to-your-app)>) to the app, and update the URL to the base of the app to the same in step #1.

3. Update your PagerDuty Client ID and Secret under `src/config/constants.js` (consider external API call)  
   (Don't forget to add and commit changes!)

4. (_Optional_) Create `gh-pages` branch for tracking

   - `$ git checkout -b gh-pages`
   - `$ git branch --set-upstream gh-pages origin/gh-pages`
   - `$ git push`
   - `$ git checkout -`

5. Install `gh-pages` module via `$ npm install gh-pages --save-dev --global`

6. Deploy application to GitHub Pages via `$ npm run deploy`

7. Application will be accessible under the homepage specified in step #1.
